# Breast Cancer Survival Prediction

- This project's goal is to use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on Breast cancer patients to predict the survival of patients from their condition and estimated survival time. This is a binary classification problem as the survival status can either be living or deceased. I hope to use supervised emsemble trees machine learning model for this problem.

- This project is important because breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the world. By predict cancer patient survival from their clinical data given a projected survival time, we can know which patients are at higher risk of death. My machine learning model can be used to identify high risk breast cancer patients and suggest that the patients need more medical care. From my model, we can also understand which clinical features are important and affect patients' survival. My goal is to build a high performing model to predict breast cancer patient survival.
